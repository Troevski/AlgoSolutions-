About the repository:

This repository was created as a personal archive of my solutions to various programming problems, covering algorithms, logic problems and more. 
The goal here is not just to collect code, but to reflect the path of my learning and development in the field of algorithmic problem solving.

Motivation:

The idea to create this repository came from the desire to have a centralized place to store the history of my solutions. 
This is not only a way to preserve achievements and progress, but also a way to go back to solved problems in the future, to analyze and improve them. 
I believe that this approach will give me a deeper understanding of the material I have learned and will be an incentive for continuous self-improvement.
